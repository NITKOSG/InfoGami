During the starting years in the college , a student has no idea about college, students around him, people of his/her interest, their social accounts, contact with seniors and alumnis etc.
So bringing all these things together makes InfoGami.

  - Ask questions related to college, coding, developing etc. ( sorted according to the fields).
  - Meet people of your interest and skills.
  - Get the skill statistics of a person and the entire college.
  - Search on the basis of interests and skills.
  - Create groups in college for meetups.
  - Create events, meetups or talks.
  - Suggest an event to take user views and votes for that particular event.
  - Work collaboratively : Find and host projects of your interest in college.
  - Write blog
  - The Info : A search engine which gives best results.

Technologies Used :

- Python
- Django

Will be started in NIT Kurukshetra.
